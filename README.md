# Description
For this project we were tasked by adding code to the script.js that works with the scripts in the html file and also debug the html file. The code we needed to include has to display the current day on top of the webpage, including time blocks for a  9-5 work day that also changed based off of the user's current time, and to have any information saved in the text field to display on the page after refreshing the website.

# Contributing 
I met with my tutor, Juan Delgado, who taught and assisted me with how to break down each issue. He helped me understand that adding notes throughout the code helps with debuging any issues and creating code that flows better. Also using https://www.w3schools.com/, https://day.js.org/, and looking over the previous class work we did during class.
